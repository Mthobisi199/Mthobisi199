Morse code 

About Morse code: 
Morse code is a method used in
telecommunication to encode text characters as sequences of
two different signal durations, called dots and dashes 

The history about Morse code:
Morse code was developed in the 1830s and 1840s by Samuel Morse and his assistant Alfred Vail 
as a system for transmitting messages using electrical pulses over telegraph lines. 
Originally, it consisted of numbers and symbols, but later expanded to include letters and punctuation.
The code uses dots and dashes to represent letters, and spaces are used to separate characters and words. 

How does Morse code works including the use of dots and dashes? :

Morse code transmits messages using a system of dots and dashes, representing letters, numbers, and punctuation. 
Each character is uniquely encoded by a sequence of dots and dashes, with a specific timing system to differentiate between characters, letters, and words. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
1. Dots and Dashes:
A dot (dit) is a short signal, and a dash (dah) is a long signal. 
Each letter, number, and punctuation mark is represented by a unique combination of dots and dashes.

3. Timing:
A dot lasts one unit of time. 
A dash lasts three units of time. 
A short space between dots and dashes within a character is one unit. 
A short space between letters is three units. 
A longer space between words is seven units. 
4. Example:
The letter "A" is represented by a dot followed by a dash (·-). 
The letter "S" is represented by three dots (···). 
The letter "O" is represented by three dashes (---). 
The word "SOS" is represented by three dots, three dashes, and then three dots again (··· --- ···). 
5. How it works:
A telegraph operator (or other sender) creates a sequence of dots and dashes to form the message. 
The recipient listens to (or observes) the dots and dashes and decodes them to read the message. 
6. Versatility:
Morse code can be transmitted using a variety of methods, including sound (beeps), light (flashes), or even physical movements.
